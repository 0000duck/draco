    <p>Draco encoded mesh files are comprised of three main sections. This first
section is the header. The second section contains the connectivity data.
The third section contains the attribute data. The header must be decoded
first, then the connectivity section, and then the attribute section.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Connectivity section is composed of the following sections in order:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Connectivity header</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>EdgeBreaker symbol buffer</p>

<h3 id="method-of-describing-bitstream-syntax">Method of describing bitstream syntax</h3>

<p><strong>FIXME: This section is borrowed from AV1, and should be modified for the Draco
spec.</strong></p>

<p>The description style of the syntax is similar to the C++ programming language.
Syntax elements in the bitstream are represented in bold type. Each syntax
element is described by its name (using only lower case letters with
underscore characters) and a descriptor for its method of coded
representation. The decoding process behaves according to the value of the
syntax element and to the values of previously decoded syntax elements. When a
value of a syntax element is used in the syntax tables or the text, it appears
in regular (i.e. not bold) type. If the value of a syntax element is being
computed (e.g. being written with a default value instead of being coded in
the bitstream), it also appears in regular type.</p>

<p>In some cases the syntax tables may use the values of other variables derived
from syntax elements values. Such variables appear in the syntax tables, or
text, named by a mixture of lower case and upper case letter and without any
underscore characters. Variables starting with an upper case letter are
derived for the decoding of the current syntax structure and all depending
syntax structures. These variables may be used in the decoding process for
later syntax structures. Variables starting with a lower case letter are only
used within the process from which they are derived.</p>

<p>Constant values appear in all upper case letters with underscore characters.</p>

<p>Constant lookup tables appear in all lower case letters with underscore
characters.</p>

<p>Hexadecimal notation, indicated by prefixing the hexadecimal number by <code class="highlighter-rouge">0x</code>,
may be used when the number of bits is an integer multiple of 4. For example,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">0x1a</code> represents a bit string <code class="highlighter-rouge">0001 1010</code>.</p>

<p>Binary notation is indicated by prefixing the binary number by <code class="highlighter-rouge">0b</code>. For
example, <code class="highlighter-rouge">0b00011010</code> represents a bit string <code class="highlighter-rouge">0001 1010</code>. Binary numbers may
include underscore characters to enhance readability. If present, the
underscore characters appear every 4 binary digits starting from the LSB. For
example, <code class="highlighter-rouge">0b11010</code> may also be written as <code class="highlighter-rouge">0b1_1010</code>.</p>

<p>A value equal to 0 represents a FALSE condition in a test statement. The
value TRUE is represented by any value not equal to 0.</p>

<p>The following table lists examples of the syntax specification format. When
<code class="highlighter-rouge">syntax_element</code> appears (with bold face font), it specifies that this syntax
element is parsed from the bitstream.</p>
